# Data Science and Machine Learning Assignments
This repository contains assignments for the course on Data Science and Machine Learning. which aims to provide overall introduction to the machine learning models of AIML .Each assignment is organized into individual folders, with accompanying Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files and writeup in PDF format. 
Below is a brief overview of each assignment:
## Assignment 1 :
Introduction to Python and Basic Data Manipulation. also explores basic concepts of Numpy and Pandas Libraries <br />
Problem Statement:<br />
Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable data sets:
* a) Read data from different formats (like csv, xls)
* b) Indexing and selecting data, sort data,
* c) Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column,
* d) Counting unique values of data, format of each column, converting variable data type (e.g. from long to short, vice versa),
* e) Identifying missing values and fill in the missing values.

## Assignment 2: 
This assignment involves computing summary statistics for each feature, creating histograms to visualize feature distributions, and performing data cleaning, integration, transformation, and model building tasks like classification.<br />
Perform the following operations using R/Python on the data sets:
* a) Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. (e.g. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance and percentiles)
* b) Data Visualization - Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.
* c) Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation, Data model building (e.g. Classification)

## Assignment 3:
Applied appropriate machine learning algorithms, on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop to predict customer response for special offers. Implemented model evaluation techniques to assess the performance of the regression models. Used K-nearest Neighbors.<br />
Problem Statement :<br /> 
Apply appropriate ML algorithm on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of 
customers to predict customer response for special offer.

## Assignment 4:

Includes a program to perform k-means clustering with given initial centroids on a collection of 8 points. The cluster to which a particular point belongs is determined, the population of a cluster around a specific centroid is calculated, and the updated values of centroids after clustering iterations are obtained. <br />
problem statement : <br />
We have given a collection of 8 points. P1=[0.1,0.6] P2=[0.15,0.71] P3=[0.08,0.9] P4=[0.16,0.85] P5=[0.2,0.3] P6=[0.25,0.5] P7=[0.24,0.1] P8=[0.3,0.2]. Perform the k-mean clustering with initial centroids as m1=P1=Cluster#1=C1 and m2=P8=cluster#2=C2. 
Answer the following:
* a) Which cluster does P6 belongs to?
* b) What is the population of cluster around m2?
* c) What is updated value of m1 and m2?

## Assignment 5:
Visualize the data using R/Python by plotting the graphs for assignment no. 1 and 2. Considering a suitable dataset. Used Scatter plot, bar plot, Box plot, and Histogram to analyze the data.<br />
Problem Statement : <br />
Visualize the data using R/Python by plotting the graphs for assignment no. 1 and 2. Consider suitable data set. Use Scatter plot, bar plot, Box plot and Histogram.

## Assignment 6:
Assignment on Regression technique.dataset was related to temperature. Applied Linear Regression using a SkLearn library function to predict the Month-wise temperature. Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Visualize the simple regression model.<br />
Problem Statement : <br />
Assignment on Regression technique. Download temperature data from below link. https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures of all places month wise. Temperatures values are recorded in CELSIUS 
* a) Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the Month-wise 
temperature.
* b) Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square metrics
* c) Visualize simple regression model.

## Assignment 7:
Assignment on Classification technique. Built a machine learning model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a student will get admission to foreign universities based on GRE score and Academic Score. Applied data pre-processing techniques such as Label Encoding and Data Transformation if necessary, performed data-preparation (Train-Test Split), applied the Decision Tree algorithm, and evaluated the model.<br />
Problem Statement:<br />
Assignment on Classification technique
Every year many students give the GRE exam to get admission in foreign Universities. The data set contains GRE Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating (out of 5), Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5), Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes), Admitted (0=no, 1=yes). Admitted is the target variable. Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions The counselor of the firm is supposed check whether the student will get an admission or not based on his/her GRE score and Academic Score. So to help the counselor to take appropriate decisions build a machine learning model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a student will get admission or not.
* a) Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformationâ€¦.) techniques if
necessary. 
* b) Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
* c) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
* d) Evaluate Model
